Today I'm proud to announce the public launch of Cocode. Cocode is a company
formed from the team behind Palaver, an awesome IRC client for iOS.

Our first product to branded launched under this new company is Palaver, but it
doesn't stop there. We are busy working on some new and exciting products
and services. We aim to bring some secure and privacy focused services and
applications to the table in the near future.

After Palaver, we have had many great ideas on future projects and how to go
further with Palaver, it was clear we had to form an organisation to properly
structure and organise our projects.

We've had some great feedback from our customers and we are happy to announce
that Palaver 2.0 is in the works. This is a huge step for us and we will
hopefully have an update on this in the form of a blog post when we are closer
to releasing.

What is Palaver?
----------------

For those of you unaware of what Palaver is, it's an iPhone and iPad app which
allows you to real-time communicate with other people. Palaver is a rather niche app,
since it uses an existing protocol for real-time conversations.

Here is an example of what the public thinks about Palaver:

    I don't usually write reviews because I'm lazy...but this one is warranted.
    This irc client destroys the competition. I had been using colloquy for months
    and was losing my mind with how bad it was (no notifications or severely
    delayed notifications, message syncing problems, etc). This app solves that and
    with a much cleaner interface. Thank you whoever you are who made this app.

The team behind Coocde
----------------------

Cocode is currently made up of three individuals. That is me, Kyle Fuller. The
lead developer. Dennis Collaris, an awesome designer from Holland who did
the beautiful design that you are currently looking at, along with the entire
user interface for Palaver. Last but not least, Sam Jones. Sam is a new
developer to our team and he is busy working on some future projects.
